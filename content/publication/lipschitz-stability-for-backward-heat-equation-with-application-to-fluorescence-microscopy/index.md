abstract: In this work, we study a Lipschitz stability result in the
  reconstruction of a compactly supported initial temperature for the heat
  equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$, from measurements along a positive time interval
  and over an open set containing its support. We take advantage of the explicit
  dependency of solutions to the heat equation with respect to the initial
  condition. By means of Carleman estimates we obtain an analogous result for
  the case when the observation is made along an exterior region
  $\omega\times(\tau,T)$, such that the unobserved part
  $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\omega$ is bounded. In the latter setting, the method
  of Carleman estimates gives a general conditional logarithmic stability result
  when initial temperatures belong to a certain admissible set, and without the
  assumption of compactness of support. Furthermore, we apply these results to
  deduce a similar result for the heat equation in $\mathbb{R}$ for measurements
  available on a curve contained in $\mathbb{R}\times[0,∞)$, from where a
  stability estimate for an inverse problem arising in 2D Fluorescence
  Microscopy is deduced as well. In order to further understand this Lipschitz
  stability, in particular, the magnitude of its stability constant with respect
  to the noise level of the measurements, a numerical reconstruction is
  presented based on the construction of a linear system for the inverse problem
  in Fluorescence Microscopy. We investigate the stability constant with the
  condition number of the corresponding matrix.
