Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world, thus it is necessary a fully-understanding of its biomechanical behaviour. One attempt to do so is the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, one of the most successful mathematical models that describe excitable media, that is, materials consisting of elementary segments with well-defined res state, a threshold for excitation and a diffusive-type coupling to its nearest neighbours. Hence, this model is useful for modelling different phenomena such as nerve pulses, spreading of forest fires or certain types of chemical reactions. In particular, it is used in cardiac electrophysiology to qualitatively describe the voltage propagation through the cardiac tissue. Consequently, it is possible to gain some insights on heart imparities such as arrhythmias.  

The most important characteristic of excitable media is the almost immediate damping out of signals below a certain threshold. On the other hand, signals exceeding this threshold propagate without damping. In cardiac cells, ions move through small pores in the cellular membrane which can be either open (excited) or closed (rest) making the heart muscle pumping blood in and out.

The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a system of two variables and two PDEs. The variables are an \emph{activator} and an \emph{inhibitor}.
